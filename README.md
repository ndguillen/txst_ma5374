## Course format

Welcome to Numerical Linear Algebra!. This is an \textbf{online course}, which means lectures and class discussion will take place via Zoom and the forum feature on Canvas.


**Lectures.** Lectures will be delivered via Zoom. Lectures will be a mixture of live lecture and pre-recorded. The official meeting time for the class is Monday and Wednesdays from 3:30 pm to 4:50 pm. In practice, we will meet ``live'' from 3:30 to 4:20 pm and the remaining 30 mins of the lecture will be pre-recorded (and can be watched at your convenience). The live part of the lecture will be recorded and made available on Canvas for your convenience, alongside with a pdf of the notes from that lecture. 


**Office Hours**. (Via Zoom) Monday and Wednesday from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm, or by appointment (request via email at least one day in advance). 



**Forums**. Apart from lectures and office hours, the most important point of interaction for the class will be \textbf{the Canvas Discussions page}. If you have a question related to a particular problem set, or a question about a method discussed in a lecture, this should be the first place to share that question. Sometimes I will provide answers to forum questions, or use a question to explain a broader point or a method.

While a Discussion forum is not quite a replacement for the discussions we would have face to face in a classroom, experience with public forums like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange}{Stack Exchange} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathOverflow}{MathOverflow} suggests this can be a great learning tool in their own right.


**Emails**. I will get back to any email within 72 hours. Preferably, questions about the content of the class should be posted on the course forum, with email used for individual concerns or questions -- but this is not a strict rule. \textbf{Please make sure to start the subject line of your emails with ``MATH5374'', so that I can reply promptly.}


## Course overview

This course deals with numerical algorithms used to solve linear problems. Topics include condition numbers and the numerical stability of linear algorithms; matrix factorizations like the Singular Value Decomposition; the least squares method; iterative algorithms like the conjugate gradient method; and more. We will illustrate such topics by bringing examples of linear problems that arise in applications. The theory will be balanced with exercises involving the implementation of algorithms in Python.


**Prerequisites**. Linear algebra at the level of Math 3377. Basic programming skills, as well as familiarity with real analysis are helpful additions but not strictly necessary for the course.

**Course materials**. There is no required textbook, but the \emph{Numerical Linear Algebra} by Trefethen and Bau is an excellent textbook that I will be following closely. The chapters from this book relevant to our class are Chapters I, II, III, and VI. Course notes and other material (such as notes from each lecture, and external web links) will be available on Canvas.

You will be required to setup Python on your computer as well as Jupyter Notebooks -- more information on this on Canvas. A helpful resource on Python is the \href{https://scipy-lectures.org/_downloads/ScipyLectures-simple.pdf}{SciPy Lectures 2020}, available for free online. 

## Course evaluation
	
**Overview**: There will be weekly problem sets (about 10 total), a midterm, and final exam. These are weighted as follows

Problem sets: 60\%

Midterm: 20\%

Final: 20\%

Bonus points: 0.5\% extra point per bonus point earned.

**Your weekly work flow:** Apart from watching/attending the week's lectures, you are expected to check the course homepage and the Canvas Discussion page regularly. Announcements will be made via email and through the Announcement function on Canvas. I may from time to time highlight any particularly helpful forum discussions.  Problem sets will be due  \textbf{on Monday at 11:59 pm} and submitted on Canvas, the problem set from Week X, will be due on the Monday of Week X+2. 

**Problem sets**: These amount to 60\% of the final numerical grade and will be due weekly. Your lowest \textbf{TWO} problem set grades are dropped when computing your problem sets average. \textbf{Late problem sets will not be accepted save for exceptional circumstances.} If you don't submit a problem set on time you will be given a zero on that problem set. On the other hand yu could miss up to 2 problem sets and still be able to get a perfect final grade. \emph{If you have read this far into the syllabus, please provide write me an email with the subject line ``syllabus!'' --and feel free to add any interesting thing you'd like to share in the body of the email, e.g. memes, movie or book recommendations, facts about you, etc (just a blank email is fine too).}

**Grading of Problem Sets**: You will receive graded problem sets/exams a week after they were submitted. I will not be posting solutions to \textbf{all} problem or exams but will aim to post solutions for about half of the problems. You are encouraged to stop by office hours to discuss the solution of any given problem or to discuss in the Forum.

**Bonus points**: Bonus points can be obtained by solving more difficult (optional) problems, such problems will be present in several weekly problems sets and will be denoted with an asterisk: *. In a few instances \textbf{additional Bonus Problems will be posted in the Course Forum}. To illustrate the role of Bonus Points, if your final numerical grade (before Bonus Points) is 83\% and you earned credit for 14 bonus problems throughout the semester, you would get 14 Bonus Points = 7\% points so your final numerical grade will be 90\% (corresponding to A). Bonus problems will be more challenging and you will only earn credit for them if the solution is entirely correct (that is, you cannot earn partial Bonus Points).

**Submission guidelines**: Your submitted problem sets and exams must be handwritten, on blank letter size paper (i.e. standard size printer paper), scanned, and submitted in PDF format. Files should be named as: YourLastName\_ProbSetN.pdf, here N is the corresponding number for the Problem Set.

**Important dates**: As mentioned earlier, problem sets will be due on Mondays at 11:59 pm. 

  * First problem set due} Monday, February 1st.

  * Midterm: Wednesday, March 31st.

  * Final: Date TBA


**Final Course Grade**:  Your final numerical grade is placed on a scale of 100. Your final letter grade will be computed from your final numerical grade as follows:
