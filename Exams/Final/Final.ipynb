    "There are 6 problems, you must do **all** of them. All problems are worth the same number of points ($100/6 \\approx 16.6$ points each). Remember you are not allowed to consult **any material other than the following**: 1. Course lecture notes 2. Trefethen and Bau's book 3. Solomon's book 4. Notebooks from our class. Good luck! \n",

    "You must submit your solutions (scan of your solutions **in the PDF format** plus a notebook with your code) no latter than 11:59 pm on Saturday December 10th.\n",

    "1. Let $A$ be a $n\\times n$ invertible matrix, suppose there is a positive definte matrix $P$ such that $ P^2 = A^tA $. Show that the matrix $Q := AP^{-1}$ must be orthogonal. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let $A$ be the $n\\times n$ matrix given by $$ A = \\lambda_1 v_1\\otimes v_1 + \\ldots +\\lambda_n v_n\\otimes v_n$$ where the $v_1,\\ldots,v_N$ are an orthonormal basis fo $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n$ are some given numbers.  Suppose the eigenvalues $\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_N$ all lie in some interval $(a,b)$ and that $f(t)$ is an **analytic function** in that interval. Then **we define** the matrix $f(A)$ by the formula $$ A = f(\\lambda_1) v_1\\otimes v_1 + \\ldots +f(\\lambda_n) v_n\\otimes v_n$$ This allows us, for example, to define $\\sqrt{A}$ for any positive definite matrix $A$. Show that $\\sqrt{A}$ times itself equals $A$. **Hint**: Note that the form of $A$ gives you a matrix decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. This question is a computational counterpart to the previous two questions. Write a Python function which takes as input a $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ and outputs a positive definite matrix $P$ such that $P^2 = A^tA$. Produce two random $2x2$ matrices (say, sampling a normal distribution to generate their entries), for each case, compute $Q := A P^{-1}$ and compute the (Frobenius) norm of the difference between $Q^tQ$ and $I$. **Note**: In creating this function the Scipy function ``scipy.linalg.eig`` should be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Let $A$ be an $n\\times n$ positive definite matrix, $b\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $z_* \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ solve $Az = b$. Suppose our initial guess for gradient descent is $z_0 = z_* + t e$ where $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $e$ is a unit eigenvector of $A$, $Ae = \\lambda e$ for some $\\lambda>0$. Then, show that gradient descent starting from $x_0$ produces the solution to $Az=b$ after just **one** iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. You are given an array $y$ of length $m = 100$ (file named `data.npy`, same folder as this Notebook), this array was generated by first choosing a \"slope\" $\\alpha$ (unknown to you!), taking the array $x = [0.00,0.01,0.02,\\ldots,0.98,0.99]$, and then computing $$ y_i = mx_i + (0.1)^*\\xi_i,\\;\\;i=0,1,2,\\ldots$$  where the $m$ numbers $\\xi_1,\\xi_2,\\ldots$ were generated by sampling from the normal distributon. Set up a least squares problem to estimate, from the data $y$, the value of the slope $m$. You are of course allowed (and encouraged) to use the least square solver in ``scipy.linalg`` **Hint**: In the least squares problem you are considering a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n=1$) with image a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ ($m=100$).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be two orthonormal vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, show that the matrix $A = I + v_1\\otimes v_2$ is always invertible and its inverse has the form $I + \\alpha v_1\\otimes v_2$ for a well chosen value of $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n"
