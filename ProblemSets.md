# Problem Set 1



Plans for the problem sets


Problem Set 1

1. Set up Python as well as Jupyter on your computer. Make sure you can run the first notebook (this requires numpy, pyplot, and scipy).
2. If $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, show the following inequalities hold

$\|x\|_\infty \leq \|x\|_2$

Some examples to learn about numerical instability (use some ill-condition problems)



Problem Set 2

Some least squares and some image matching numerical problems

Some exercises involving Gauss-Jordan analysis?

More examples illustrating ill-conditioned problems



Problem Set 3

Learn about sparse matrices and the various sparse matrices formats -- work on exercises defining sparse matrices in a variety of ways

Solve several large scale problems using the sparse matrix and the dense matrix format and compare execution + processing times

Solve some linear problems set on graphs or surfaces, maybe?
