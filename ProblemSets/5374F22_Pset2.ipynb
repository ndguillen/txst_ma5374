Moreover, show that if $A$ if $n\\leq m$ and $A$ is of maximum rank (i.e. $\\text{rank}(A) = n, n= \\min\\{m,n\\}$), then $A^tA$ is invertible.       \n",

Namely, we are going to generate a list of matrices with larger and larger condition number, and for each matrix we will solve two slightly different equations (by merely changing the right hand side a little bit), then we will plot the relative error between these two slightly different problems as a function of $k$, to visualize the growth in the error.\n",
